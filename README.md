Prepare ahead meal system for the discerning autistic anorexic nerd.

## What is this?
The idea of this is to prepare all of these meals all at the same time, committing the day or two need to prepare all of them, reducing the impact of eating on deep thinking work. These recipies were all generated with OpenAI ChatGPT 4o as a starting place and will be modified as needed.
